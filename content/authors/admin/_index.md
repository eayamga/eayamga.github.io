Eric Ayamga is a PhD candidate in Economics at Texas Tech University, specializing in industrial organization (IO) and energy economics. His research leverages advanced IO methodologies to evaluate the impacts of health policies on market structures, competition, and consumer welfare, with a focus on how regulatory interventions influence healthcare delivery, pricing dynamics, and access equity. Complementing this, Eric investigates the interplay between energy commodities, market volatility, and macroeconomic indicators, particularly examining how the global energy transition, driven by shifts toward renewables and decarbonization affects inflation trajectories, supply chains, and economic stability in both developed and emerging markets.

With a strong foundation in econometric modeling, game theory, and empirical analysis, Eric's work bridges theoretical frameworks with real-world policy applications, aiming to inform evidence-based decision-making in public health and energy sectors. He has presented his findings at academic conferences and contributed to interdisciplinary discussions on sustainable development and economic resilience. Prior to his doctoral studies, Eric earned his master's degree in Economics, where he developed a passion for applying quantitative tools to address pressing societal challenges.

Outside of research, Eric is committed to mentoring undergraduate students and engaging in community outreach on economic literacy, particularly in the context of Texas's evolving energy landscape. He actively collaborates with scholars and industry experts to advance knowledge in these critical areas. Eric can be reached via LinkedIn or academic networks for potential collaborations or discussions.
